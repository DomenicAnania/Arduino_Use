//Below this code you need to add all of void functions that will run your action table code

//This is the first one, colorWipe, a few things need to happen when you hack found code
//1) check the words and make sure their yours and not from the coder you stole from.
//2) if there is a for loop use our term ringTotal instead


// Fill the dots one after the other with a color
void colorWipe(uint32_t c, uint8_t wait) {
  //for loop is missing how many leds we have to change, either put the number or the word you made
  //to represent that number - ringTotal
  for(uint16_t i=0; i< ; i++) {
    //Use your word to represent the neo pixel ring from the orange text Adafruit_NeoPixel...
    [place your ring name here].setPixelColor(i, c);
    [place your ring name here].show();
    delay(wait);
  }
}

//Now paste in the rainbow function, dont forget to make your 2 types of changes like above


//Wait does rainbow have a new function to add?


//Now paste in rainbowCycle & make the 2 types of changes


//Now paste theatre chase


//Now paste theatre chase rainbow
